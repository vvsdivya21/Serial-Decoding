Data Encoding and Serialization: A Historical and Technical Overview

Overview

This repository explores the evolution of data encoding and serialization, tracing its roots from ancient communication methods to modern high-speed data transfer protocols. Encoding data efficiently and reliably is a crucial aspect of digital communication, ensuring that information can be transmitted accurately across distances and networks. Here, we examine the origins, development, and complexities of encoding, highlighting protocols from historical methods like smoke signals and Morse code to the highly structured formats used in digital systems.

Historical Context

Smoke Signals

	•	Origins: The earliest known encoding method dates back to 1500 BCE, with the use of smoke signals to convey simple messages.
	•	Protocol: A single smoke puff indicated “I am here,” two puffs signaled “all is ok,” and three puffs conveyed “there is something wrong.” Despite its limitations in speed and weather dependency, this technique provided a basic form of speed-of-light communication.

Morse Code

	•	Invention: In the 19th century, telegraphy revolutionized communication with Morse code, using short (dot) and long (dash) pulses over telephone lines or radio frequencies.
	•	Key Signals: The SOS distress signal (• • • ‒ ‒ ‒ • • •) became universally recognized.
	•	Bandwidth: Skilled operators could encode and decode around 20-30 words per minute—a significant improvement over prior methods.

Technical Overview: Modern Data Protocols

With advancements in computing, data transmission has evolved into structured binary protocols using bits and bytes. This transition allows information to be transmitted with greater efficiency and accuracy, while encoding standards ensure compatibility across systems.

Parallel and Serial Communication

	•	Parallel Communication: Early computers used parallel communication to transmit data as eight parallel bits, effectively sending a byte at a time.
	•	Serial Communication: Standards like UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) and USB (Universal Serial Bus) allow data to be transmitted one bit at a time over a single wire. This method facilitates the communication of large datasets across systems.

Encoding and Decoding Data

When transferring data, such as RGB values in images, binary representation significantly reduces bandwidth usage compared to character-based encoding. For example, a color represented by [109, 000, 157] requires only three bytes in binary, but at least nine characters in text format, increasing the bandwidth by a factor of three.

Data Frame Structure

Header

Each data frame contains structured header bytes to guide the transmission and ensure data integrity.

	•	Bytes 1-2: Identifies the start of each data frame.
	•	Bytes 3-5: Origin and destination identifiers.
	•	Byte 6: Sequence number, incremented per frame. This helps detect any missed frames.
	•	Byte 7: Data type identifier, often referencing a documentation lookup (e.g., in MAVLink, ID 16 is a waypoint location).

Payload

	•	Byte 8: Marks the start of payload data.
	•	Bytes 9-14: These pairs represent signed or unsigned 16-bit integers, extending the range of numerical values.
	•	Bytes 15-16: Referenced via a lookup table to interpret the exact physical value.

Time

	•	Byte 17: Indicates the start of timing bytes.
	•	Bytes 18-25: An 8-byte timestamp in microseconds since the Unix epoch. This allows precision in time-sensitive data transmission.

Checksum

A checksum is calculated to verify data integrity across the frame, using a simple algorithm:

	1.	Sum all byte values in the message (excluding the checksum byte).
	2.	Take the modulo of this sum against 256.
	3.	Subtract the result from 255 to get the checksum value.
	4.	If the computed checksum doesn’t match the value in byte 26, the data frame may be corrupted.

Checksum protocols provide essential data integrity, particularly useful in noisy communication environments.

Applications in Modern Encoding Formats

Data encoding protocols like JPEG, PNG, GIF, and TIFF follow defined conventions for writing RGB values directly to files in binary form. For video transmission, even greater efficiencies are achieved through data compression, allowing high-resolution, real-time streaming at manageable data rates despite bandwidth limitations.
